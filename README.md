# LaserTagBirthdayNames
Birthday name generator using Python and HTML
Program coded in Python using tkinter to generate an html file and add in text from user input
The goal was to create a name generator program for Invasion Laser Tag to be Chromecasted for Birthday parties
I just used 4 css files instead of actually creating the style in html for each color. Reason for this was incase changes needed to be made so I don't have to recompile the .exe using Nuitka
The program is simple with a generate party button and 4 colors to change the text of the birthday tag and user inputted name


#Changelog
Default selections: color blue, fireworks.mp4
Added ability to change background movie with 5 new buttons added
